Just got out from 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 “Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness. Let me just say: what was that even? I mean, honestly, it's like being wrapped in cotton candy and then slapped with a wet fish. Sweet moments everywhere but then BAM, sudden and weird. Do 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers get a manual on how to do that? I was sitting there, slightly annoyed at first cause the popcorn was stale, but then the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 took over in this weird way. Is that what falling in love is like? Feeling kind of dazed and confused and a little bit content?

Okay, so it starts with this guy — let’s call him Sad Sir Bob because that's all I can recall — wandering through dimly lit alleyways. Seriously, it's like they borrowed all the lamps from a romantic medieval reenactment. Anyway, Bob, of course, has these big eyes. They aren't googly, like cartoonish, more like, I'm perpetually searching for meaning. Dude's deep. There's one scene where he 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩es a sunset, and the sun is basically the size of a pizza. No kidding, I almost shouted, Grab a slice, Bob! but, you know, it's a theatre and manners.

> The chemistry between Bob and the leading lady, who I have already forgotten the name of (oops), was... alright? Their conversations were something between a chemistry lecture and an accidental karaoke night. It's like they were singing without music, and there I was, thinking, Are they speaking poetry or ordering a coffee?

And here’s the kicker: halfway through the  , I started recognizing echoes of my own love life. Like that one time I tried to impress someone with homemade lasagna that ended up as pasta chaos, but in a cute way — not that the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was cute all the time, simulating life’s curveballs in the most bizarre ways. Truthfully, I was kind of defensive at first, but then I let it wash over me like a kind of zen mess.

So there, in the middle of this emotional whirlwind of a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, my brain screamed: Why not just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , have it handy when you just want to feel weirdly loved? I swear, sometimes my thoughts are rogue pigeons just flying into random windows. Probably the exhaustion setting in.

if (thereIsLove) {
    bool noDarkness = true;
}

If someone ever asks me about it, I'd say 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   — in a dim room with popcorn, but make sure the popcorn's fresh. The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮's edge will make you feel like you’re peeking into someone’s diary while simultaneously flipping through a National Geographic magazine. Random? Yes. Worth it? Maybe, depending on your love for unpredictability — or pizzas the size of sunsets.
